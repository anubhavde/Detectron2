## Training Detectron2  with Custom COCO Datasets.

In this repository, I have implemented how Detectron2 can be used in the field of computer vision and object detection.

### What is Detecron 2?
Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's next generation library that provides state-of-the-art detection and segmentation algorithms. It is the successor of Detectron and maskrcnn-benchmark. It supports a number of computer vision research projects and production applications in Facebook.
